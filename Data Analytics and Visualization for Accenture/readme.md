# Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains my completed work for the **Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation** offered through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/accenture-nam/data-analytics-mmlb?forceFastTrackV2=true). In this simulation, I acted as a Data Analyst supporting a hypothetical social media client. The experience involved:

* Cleaning, modeling, and analyzing seven raw datasets to uncover meaningful insights related to social media content trends.

* Developing recommendations based on data-driven insights to support the client's content strategy and engagement goals.

* Creating a PowerPoint presentation and a video walkthrough to effectively communicate findings to both client-facing and internal stakeholders.

This project highlights my ability to manage real-world data challenges, derive actionable insights, and present results in a compelling, stakeholder-ready format.


## Objectives

* Understand client requirements and project scope.
* Clean and model datasets to prepare for analysis.
* Perform data analysis to identify key trends and insights.
* Create visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
* Develop a presentation to summarize recommendations.
